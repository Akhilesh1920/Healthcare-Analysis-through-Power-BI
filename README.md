# Healthcare-Analysis-through-Power-BI
**Project Overview**
This project involves the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard using a dataset of 7,000 patients and 351 doctors across multiple hospitals. The goal is to improve patient care, analyze treatment outcomes, optimize hospital efficiency, and perform cost analysis through advanced data visualization.

**Purpose**
The dashboard is designed to assist hospital administrators, healthcare policymakers, and analysts in making informed, data-driven decisions. By examining key healthcare metrics, stakeholders can identify patterns, evaluate performance, and plan more effectively for future healthcare needs.

**Key Features**
Interactive Dashboard: Built using Power BI, the dashboard includes dynamic filters and slicers for a customized view of the data.

**Key Metrics Tracked:**

Number of patients

Recovery rates

Resource and treatment utilization

Cost indicators

**Age Group Segmentation**: The data is segmented by age groups to highlight health trends, disease prevalence, and treatment effectiveness. This supports more targeted healthcare strategies.

**Visual Analytics**: Charts, graphs, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) provide visual comparisons across different hospitals and patient demographics.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset contains information for 7,000 patients.

It includes details such as age, gender, disease type, treatment method, hospital code, doctor ID, recovery status, and more.

The data reflects the input of 351 doctors across different departments and specialties.

All data has been anonymized and is used strictly for analysis and learning purposes.

**Tools Used**
Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Power Query for data transformation

Microsoft Excel for initial data cleaning

**Benefits**
Helps hospital management understand patient trends and improve operations.

Enables tracking of recovery rates and the effectiveness of treatments.

Supports better planning and policy development through clear data insights.

**Conclusion**
This Power BI dashboard provides a powerful tool for analyzing healthcare data, enabling better decision-making in hospitals through clear and interactive visualizations. By identifying trends, evaluating treatment outcomes, and improving resource allocation, it supports enhanced patient care and operational efficiency. This project showcases the potential of data analytics in transforming the healthcare sector.
